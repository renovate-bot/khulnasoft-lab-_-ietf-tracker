We will soon be changing the header fields used in IETF Last Call messages sent to the IETF Announce mailing list.

This message is to to inform you of the change and allow you to test that you are properly receiving messages using the new header fields.

We are making this change to make it more likely that replies go to the intended recipients.

This message will be repeated daily using both the old and new header.
This instance of the message was sent using the {{oldornew}} header.
Please ensure you receive both versions.
These messages will cease, and all Last Call messages to this list will switch to using the new header on or shortly after {{target_date}}.

The specific changes are:

{% endfilter %}
Old:

   From: The IESG <iesg-secretary@ietf.org>
   To: IETF-Announce <ietf-announce@ietf.org>
   Reply-To: ietf@ietf.org

New:

   From: The IESG <noreply@ietf.org>
   To: IETF-Announce:;
   Reply-To: IETF Discussion List <ietf@ietf.org>

and the message sent using the New header fields will also be 
Bcc-ed to <ietf-announce@ietf.org>

Thanks for your patience as we make this adjustment,

The IESG
