    <h1>Posting approved I-D to RFC Editor failed</h1>
    <p>
        Sorry, when trying to notify the RFC Editor through HTTP, we hit an
        error.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have not changed the Internet-Draft state or sent the announcement
        yet so if this is an intermittent error, you can go back and try
        again.
    </p>
    <p>
        The error was: <code>{{ error }}</code>
    </p>
    {% if response %}
        <p>
            The response from the RFC Editor was:
            <code>{{ response|linebreaksbr }}</code>
        </p>
    {% endif %}
