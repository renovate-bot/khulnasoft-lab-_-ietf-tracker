Subject: Results of IETF-conflict review for {{ doc.file_tag }}
{% filter wordwrap:78 %}
The IESG has completed a review of <{{ doc.name }}> consistent with RFC5742.  This review is applied to all non-IETF streams.
{% if disapproved %}
The IESG recommends that '{{ doc.title }}' {{ doc.file_tag|safe }} NOT be published as {{ doc|std_level_prompt_with_article }}.
{% else %}
The IESG has no problem with the publication of '{{ doc.title }}' {{ doc.file_tag|safe }} as {{ doc|std_level_prompt_with_article }}.

The IESG would also like the IRSG or RFC-Editor to review the comments in the datatracker ({{ doc_url }}) related to this document and determine whether or not they merit incorporation into the document. Comments may exist in both the ballot and the history log.{% endif %}

A URL of this {{ doc_type }} is:
{{ doc_url }}

The process for such documents is described {% if doc.stream_id == 'ise' %}at https://www.rfc-editor.org/indsubs.html {% else %}{% if doc.stream_id == 'irtf' %}in RFC 5743 {% endif %} {% endif %}

Thank you,

The IESG Secretary
