    <h1 class="mb-3">Internet-Draft submission API instructions</h1>
    <p>
        Note: API endpoint described here is known to have a slow response time or to fail
        due to timeout for some Internet-Draft submissions, particularly those with large file sizes.
        It is recommended to use the <a href="{% url 'ietf.submit.views.api_submission' %}">new API endpoint</a>
        instead for increased reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
        A simplified Internet-Draft submission interface, intended for automation,
        is available at <code>{% absurl 'ietf.submit.views.api_submit' %}</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interface accepts only XML uploads that can be processed on the server, and
        requires the user to have a datatracker account.  A successful submit still requires
        the same email confirmation round-trip as submissions done through the regular
        <a href="{% url 'ietf.submit.views.upload_submission' %}">submission tool</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This interface does not provide all the options which the regular submission tool does.
        Some limitations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only XML-only uploads are supported, not text or combined.</li>
        <li>Document replacement information cannot be supplied.</li>
        <li>
            The server expects <code>multipart/form-data</code>, supported by <code>curl</code> but <b>not</b> by <code>wget</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It takes two parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>user</code> which is the user login
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>xml</code>, which is the submitted file
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It returns an appropriate http result code, and a brief explanatory text message.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an example:
    </p>
    <pre class="border p-3">
$ curl -S -F "user=user.name@example.com" -F "xml=@~/draft-user-example.xml" {% absurl 'ietf.submit.views.api_submit' %}
Upload of draft-user-example OK, confirmation requests sent to:
User Name &lt;user.name@example.com&gt;</pre>
