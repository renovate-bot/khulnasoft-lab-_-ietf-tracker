    <h1>Set up test email address</h1>
    <p>
        Since this server is running in test mode, all email to be sent out
        is intercepted and thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
        To receive a copy of each message before it's thrown away, you can
        set an email address below. The address is stored in the <code>testmailcc</code>
        cookie in your browser. So make sure cookies are enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Current value of <code>testmailcc</code> cookie: <code>{{ cookie|default:"(Unset)" }}</code>
