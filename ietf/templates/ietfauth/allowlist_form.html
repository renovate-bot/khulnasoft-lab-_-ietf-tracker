        <h1>Allowlist entry creation successful</h1>
        <p>
            Please ask the requestor to try the
            <a href="{% url 'ietf.ietfauth.views.create_account' %}">account creation form</a>
            again, with the allowlisted email address.

        <h1>Add an allowlist entry for account creation.</h1>
        <p>
            When an email request comes in for assistance with account creation
            because the automated account creation has failed, you can add the
            address to an account creation allowlist here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you do so, please complete the following 3 verification steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="d-grid gap-3">
            <li>
                Has the person provided relevant information in his request, or has he simply
                copied the text from the account creation failure message?  All genuine (non-spam)
                account creation requests seen between 2009 and 2016 for tools.ietf.org have
                contained a reasonable request message, rather than just copy-pasting the account
                creation failure message.  If there's no proper request message, step 2 below can
                be performed to make sure the request is bogus, but if that also fails, no further
                effort should be needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Google for the person's name within the ietf.org site: "Jane Doe site:ietf.org".  If
                found, and the email address matches an address used in Internet-Drafts or discussions,
                things are fine, and it's OK to add the address to the allowlist using this form,
                and ask the person to please try the
                <a href="{% url 'ietf.ietfauth.views.create_account' %}">account creation form</a>
                again.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If google finds no trace of the person being an ietf participant, he or she could
                    still be somebody who is just getting involved in IETF work.  A datatracker account
                    is probably not necessary, (no account is necessary to 'join' a WG -- the right thing
                    in that case is to join the right mailing list, and the person could be told so) --
                    but in case this is a legitimate request, please email the person and ask:
                    <i>
                        "Which wgs do you require a password for?"
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a bit of a trick question, because it is very unlikely that somebody who
                    isn't involved in IETF work will give a reasonable response, while almost any answer
                    from somebody who is doing IETF work will show that they have some clue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note the exact wording.  Do <b><i>not</i></b> ask about "working groups" --
                    that will make it easier for people to google for IETF working groups.  Ask the
                    question as given above, with lowercase "wgs".
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the answer to this question shows clue, then add the address to the allowlist
                    using this form, and ask the person to please try the
                    <a href="{% url 'ietf.ietfauth.views.create_account' %}">account creation form</a>
                    again.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
