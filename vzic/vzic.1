.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvzic\fP is a program to convert the Olson timezone database files into
VTIMEZONE files compatible with the iCalendar specification (RFC2445).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB--pure\fP
Output the perfect VCALENDAR data, which Outlook won't parse
as it has problems with certain iCalendar constructs.
.TP
.B
\fB--output-dir\fP
specify where to output all the files beneath. The
default is the current directory. 
.TP
.B
\fB--url-prefix\fP
Used as the base for the TZURL property in each
VTIMEZONE. The default is to not output TZURL properties. 
.PP
Debugging Options: 
.TP
.B
\fB--dump\fP
Dump the Rule and Zone data that we parsed from the Olson
timezone files. This is used to test the parsing code. 
.TP
.B
\fB--dump-changes\fP
Dumps a list of times when each timezone changed,
and the new local time offset from UTC. 
.TP
.B
\fB--no-rrules\fP
Don't output RRULE properties in the VTIMEZONEs. Instead
it will just output RDATEs for each year up to a certain year. 
.TP
.B
\fB--no-rdates\fP
Don't output multiple RDATEs in a single VTIMEZONE
component. Instead they will be output separately.
