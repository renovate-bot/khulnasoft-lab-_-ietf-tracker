This directory will be used to set up packages used for testing if they need any
special handling which should not be applied to the system-wide setup.

For instance, many of the tests to be run on the Django application should be run
with a standard Django environment; but there are some Django test features which
are broken in 0.9.6, and need patching in order to do the testing, like the ability
to create a test database to run unit tests, according to this issue and patch:
