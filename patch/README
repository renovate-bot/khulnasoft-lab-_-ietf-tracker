This directory is for patches to the datatracker environment, not for patches
to the datatracker itself (those are ephemeral, in the sense that they should
not stay around as patches, they should be committed to the repository if they
are of long-term value).

As an example, trace-django-queryset-origin.patch is a patch to django 1.10
which adds some meta-information to the query entries provided for debug
purpose by django.template.context_processors.debug as sql_queries.
